# IFT3710-Advanced-Project-in-ML-AI
The aim of the project will be to combine a CNN architecture with dilated convolutions and include them in GANs to generate biological cell segmentation. We will also compare this new architecture with state-of-the-art models, as well as with more rudimentary models.

## Preprocessing
Go to `src/data_preprocess` and run the python script `preprocessing.py`.
